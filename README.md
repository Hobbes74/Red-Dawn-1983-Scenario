The XCOM Project is activated during one of the heights of the Cold War, with Earth divided between the Western and Eastern blocs, both heavily armed and ready for WW3.

Work in progress - the game is still on development, so expect bugs, crashes, broken saves, etc. And please report any bugs to the specific Steam or Discord threads.

Includes:
* Seven new player factions to replace the vanilla ones: Strategic Defense Initiative, Operation RYaN, UN Secretariat, New World Order, Third Front, Gladio and SETI;
