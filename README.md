The XCOM Project is activated during one of the heights of the Cold War, with Earth divided between the Western and Eastern blocs, both heavily armed and ready for WW3.

Work in progress - the game is still on development, so expect bugs, crashes, broken saves, etc. And please report any bugs to the specific Steam or Discord threads.

To keep things simple and easier for players, the mod will always require the Terra Invicta release version - development changes will only be added to the mod once they move from betas/validation to the release version.

Includes:
* Seven new player factions to replace the vanilla ones: XCOM Project, Operation RYaN, UN Secretariat, New World Order, Strategic Defense Initiative, Gladio and SETI Initiative;
* 40+ XCOM exclusive organizations, including headquarters, seven regional bases, nine research divisions, twenty-four combat teams and additional special faction units;
* The nations and the bilateral relationships have been reset to the year of 1983, with the corresponding flags and names;
* Starting armies increased and renamed, nuclear and space programs also reset to the 1980s;
* 50+ historical organizations: KGB, FEMA, NASA, Stasi, Spetsnaz, Pravda, TASS, MiG, Sukhoi, Tupolev and others;
* New KGB Officer trait, exclusive to RYaN faction's starting council member, allows to purchase/use the KGB orgs;
* New Communist trait for councillors with three levels, required to purchase/use Eastern orgs, gives several bonuses but it also causes loyalty drops;
* Western orgs can't be purchased/used by councillors with the Communist trait;
* Environmental conditions (CO2, methane, etc.) and space programs reduced to reflect 1983;
* Miltech reduced by 0.3-0.5 points depending on the country;
